Well, at least bash. I have been programming for about 3 years, and as of writing this, only about two weeks in the bash programing language. This was my first program. It's simple and it works. For my purposes at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nAnyone is free to use, or modify easy-audio. Do what ever you want with it. All I ask is for credit!\r\n",
